## Overview of Election Audit Project
Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressioal election. With the help of Tom I was able to run a python script in vs code that allowed me do the following:

1. Collect the data we needed for analysis.
2. Calculate the total number of votes casted.
3. Complete a list of counties.
4. Claculated total votes and percentage for each county.
5. Calculate the largest county vote turnout.
6. A complete list of canidates who received votes.
7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
9. Determine the winner of the election.

## Summary of Election Audit
The election audit script is efficient and can be manipulated in numerous ways that can be used in any election. For one, the variables could be changed in order to find other specific information, change it from counties to states if you are looking at a national election. As well as using this script to look at other small elections, in schools, work, programs etc. The variables would just need to be changed accordingly and vote counts could be properly found. Another way is that if more information is provided you can add more variables to find election results, such as demographics, that can be used to get a more exhaustive analysis.
